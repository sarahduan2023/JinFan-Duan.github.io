《Dangerous moment》
When the world has changed rapidly and radically in an extraordinary way, if you still respond step by step and regard the crisis as fluctuations, you will soon be overwhelmed by danger. When the big trend has reversed, if you still use the rearview mirror historical induction method, you will stand on the wrong side of the trend.

In times of crisis, only radical changes can survive, abandon all inherent prejudices, look at problems from a new perspective, learn at the fastest speed, make the worst plan, and make the greatest efforts.

Crisis is the trough of everyone, making everyone fall into the abyss at the same time, but it allows everyone to learn an important life lesson.
